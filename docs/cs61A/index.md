!!! Abstract

    This is a course from UC Berkeley. The version I take is Fall 2020, by John DeNero(so cool!!!) and Hany Farid.

    The course mainly focuses on basic computer science concepts, and the main programming language is Python.
    Addtionally, it will cover something on scheme and SQL.
    
    I finished most of the lab, hw and proj using Vmware(Ubuntu22.04), on Windows.
